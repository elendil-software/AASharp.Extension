# AASharp.Extension

AASharp.Extension provides helper classes and methods allowing using [AASharp](https://github.com/jsauve/AASharp) more easily.

Currently very few functions are available, but others will be added. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/elendil-software/AASharp.Extension/issues) to suggest new capability.
